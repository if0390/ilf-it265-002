\#### Goals for this Module

\- \[x] Set up GitHub repository

\- \[x] Configure SSH keys for authentication

\- \[x] Clone repository to local

\- \[x] Create studio brainstorm document

\- \[x] Enable GitHub Pages



\#### Progress

\- \*\*What I accomplished\*\*:

&nbsp; - Created GitHub repository for the course

&nbsp; - Generated SSH key and added it to GitHub

&nbsp; - Fixed PowerShell to recognize git commands permanently

&nbsp; - Cloned repo successfully using SSH

&nbsp; - Completed studio brainstorm document

&nbsp; - Enabled GitHub Pages to deploy from /docs folder

\- \*\*Challenges faced\*\*:

&nbsp; - SSH key wasn't saving to the correct folder initially

&nbsp; - PowerShell didn't recognize git commands — kept saying "git is not recognized"

&nbsp; - SSH kept saying "permission denied" when trying to clone

&nbsp; - Prefer using PowerShell terminal over Git Bash

\- \*\*Solutions\*\*:

&nbsp; - Used full file path when generating SSH key

&nbsp; - Added Git to system PATH permanently

&nbsp; - Created SSH config file to tell SSH which key to use for GitHub

&nbsp; - Adapted Git Bash commands to work in PowerShell



\#### Learnings

\- SSH keys have two parts: private (keep secret) and public (share with GitHub)

\- The SSH config file can specify which key to use for different hosts

\- GitHub Pages can deploy markdown files as web pages from a /docs folder

\- Git Bash and PowerShell use different path formats

\- You can use Git in PowerShell if you add it to your system PATH

\- Markdown files render as web pages on GitHub Pages when you remove the .md extension from the URL

\- Version control setup is a one-time process per machine — once SSH is configured, it works for all future repos



\#### Free Thinking

\- Setting up version control properly from the start will make future assignments easier

\- Having a consistent workflow between terminal and GitHub helps avoid confusion

\- I prefer PowerShell over Git Bash because I'm more familiar with it — good to know both work fine

\- Still need to develop a logo sketch for Utopia Works — thinking about the duality theme



\#### Next Steps

\- Create logo sketch for studio branding

\- Start planning game concept

\- Research game mechanics
