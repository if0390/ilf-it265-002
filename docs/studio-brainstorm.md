\- \*\*Chosen Name\*\*: Utopia Works

\- \*\*About the name\*\*: Utopia Works represents the belief that it is possible for all people to build whatever type of world they desire whether it's a perfect utopia or a chaotic dystopia, it's yours to build. In a society that seems mostly dysfunctional, playing video games provides you with an opportunity to escape and discover new worlds, as well as the opportunity to think creatively about what could exist. This studio is about creating those worlds - places that provide players with a sense of liberation, excitement, and a place to feel like they belong. The Works reflects the act of creation itself, like a workshop where new worlds are forged.

\## Additional Notes

\*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.\*



> Inspired by games like Genshin Impact, Hollow Knight, Twisted Wonderland and a few other games.

> Placing ideas down as unsure what exactly my brain can come up with, which is why most things are like here and there. Had fun a bit with taglines though and have been thinking on how to vision the logo. Just hard since its like there but its not if that makes sense.

> Although I choose Utopia, I didn't mean to write that at first as while researching, I meant to write dystopia but instead wrote Utopia and didn't realize the mistake until I had to think about values that I realize that I made a mistake. Still stuck with it since it feel ironic? At least to me also because I was thinking of Zootopia.

> Pretty new to creating a studio. I know its only for this class but like its hard to think of since I wasn't sure what was right and what needs to be put in for each section.

> I have an idea for logo like half and half. A building or something of having one part being like white and perfect and stuff while the other side is like decaying and black with ruin. In my head it looks okay but to sketch might be hard. However we don't know as I try to figure out how to sketch.

> I'm not sure entirely on tools as I know I will be using unity as I know it but art and audio tools, I'm not sure entirely what I'll use so I just place a few that I think I would use but not sure if I will but its there.
