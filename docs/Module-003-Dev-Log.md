\#### Goals for this Module

\- \[x] Participate in class discussion on what makes games bad

\- \[x] Analyze 3 games and identify bad mechanics

\- \[x] Offer solutions to fix those mechanics

\- \[x] Reply constructively to a classmate's post



\#### Progress

\- \*\*What I accomplished\*\*:

&nbsp; - Analyzed three games I've played: Arknights, Twisted Wonderland, and Chaos Zero Nightmare

&nbsp; - Identified 2 bad mechanics per game and explained why they hurt the experience

&nbsp; - Proposed solutions that improve mechanics without just removing them

&nbsp; - Responded to a classmate's post about Infinity Nikki with my own perspective on co-op features



\- \*\*Challenges faced\*\*:

&nbsp; - Thinking of solutions that actually fix problems rather than just removing the mechanic entirely

&nbsp; - Balancing my personal frustration with objective analysis of why mechanics don't work

  - Also figuring out what exactly was ruining the experience for the games



\- \*\*Solutions\*\*:

&nbsp; - Focused on what the mechanic was trying to accomplish and found ways to achieve that goal without the frustrating parts



\#### Learnings

\- Bad mechanics often come from prioritizing monetization over player experience

\- Localization quality can make or break a story-driven game — tone and nuance matter as much as accurate translation

\- Grinding feels bad when there's no way to experiment without punishment

\- Features that feel "tacked on" like limited co-op can be worse than no feature at all

\- Good game design means understanding WHY a mechanic exists before trying to fix it

\- Solutions should preserve the original purpose while removing the frustration



\#### Free Thinking

\- A lot of the "bad" mechanics I identified are tied to free-to-play monetization — makes me think about how my own games could avoid predatory design

\- Practice modes and skip tickets seem like simple quality-of-life features, but they massively improve player experience

\- Playing so many games and seeing the mechanics that I didn't take the time to actually understand if it was making the game good or not

\- I keep getting distracted from doing my dailies instead of checking out the mechanics properly



\#### Next Steps

\- Continue brainstorming game concepts

\- Think about what mechanics I want to include (and avoid) in my own games
