\#### Goals for this Module

\- \[x] Select a game from the Atari game list

\- \[x] Play the game using an emulator

\- \[x] Research the game's history, mechanics, and impact

\- \[x] Complete the case study worksheet



\#### Progress

\- \*\*What I accomplished\*\*:

&nbsp; - Selected Haunted House for my case study

&nbsp; - Played the game through a browser-based emulator

&nbsp; - Researched game history, developer background, mechanics, visuals, audio, narrative, and reception

&nbsp; - Completed all sections of the case study worksheet

&nbsp; - Learned about early survival horror game design



\- \*\*Challenges faced\*\*:

&nbsp; - Emulator had no control instructions

&nbsp; - Kept pressing keys that changed difficulty settings instead of moving the character

&nbsp; - Almost broke pc by the amount of times of random button pressing

&nbsp; - Graphics are very primitive and hard to interpret without context



\- \*\*Solutions\*\*:

&nbsp; - Found the original game manual online to understand controls and objectives

&nbsp; - Learned arrow keys move, spacebar lights matches, F2 starts the game

&nbsp; - Used research to fill in gaps the game itself doesn't explain



\#### Learnings

\- Haunted House is considered one of the earliest survival horror games

\- 1980s games relied heavily on instruction manuals — the game itself explained nothing

\- The game was made by a single programmer, which was normal for that era

\- Atari didn't credit developers on packaging, which caused frustration and led to the first video game Easter egg

\- Sound design was crucial for gameplay since the screen was almost entirely dark

\- Horror atmosphere can be created through mechanics not just graphics



\#### Free Thinking

\- Interesting how old games created fear through limitation rather than showing scary things though it didn't really feel scary to me

\- I mean its pretty good given its time and I do like that it that it didn't need like over the top graphics and such to make scary, its just not my cup of tea

\- The item management forces real decisions, and got me thinking more on what to get and if i should give up



\#### Next Steps

\- Upload case study PDF to GitHub

\- Think about how classic game mechanics could inspire my own game designs
