\#### Goals for this Module

\- \[x] Analyze color usage in Haunted House (Atari 2600)

\- \[x] Compare to modern horror games

\- \[x] Propose a modern color redesign

\- \[x] Design UI/UX using color theory principles

\- \[x] Create visual mockups



\#### Progress

\- \*\*What I accomplished\*\*:

&nbsp; - Analyzed how Haunted House uses black/darkness as its main atmospheric tool

&nbsp; - Compared color evolution from 1981 to modern horror games (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Phasmophobia)

&nbsp; - Created a redesign proposal using a split-complementary color scheme

&nbsp; - Designed color palette: Burgundy, Green, Gold

&nbsp; - Proposed narrative through color — warm tones at top floors fading to green in the basement

&nbsp; - Designed complementary sound cues to match color zones

&nbsp; - Created UI mockups including candle-flame health indicators, floor map, and inventory system



\- \*\*Challenges faced\*\*:

&nbsp; - Understanding how to apply color harmony rules to game design

&nbsp; - Balancing adding color while preserving the original's minimalist horror feel

&nbsp; - Making sure the design would be accessible for colorblind players



\- \*\*Solutions\*\*:

&nbsp; - Used split-complementary scheme to create visual tension that fits horror

&nbsp; - Kept restraint as a principle — every color has a specific purpose

&nbsp; - Added shape language to back up color so no mechanic relies on color alone



\#### Learnings

\- The original Haunted House's near-total absence of color IS its color theory — black does the work

\- Color harmony rules are tools, not strict rules — the genre determines which harmony to use

\- Warm colors naturally feel safe; cool colors feel threatening

\- Color can tell a story without words — floor color gradients can show descent from life into death

\- Players learn color language quickly and interact more intuitively when color has meaning

\- Effective color design works below conscious awareness — players feel it before they analyze it

\- Green is normally "safe" in everyday life, so using it as danger creates cognitive dissonance and unease

\- Accessibility matters — high value contrast helps colorblind players distinguish elements



\#### Free Thinking

\- For Utopia Works, color could reinforce the duality theme — warm/pure vs cool/corrupted

\- UI should communicate through color without relying on text or numbers

\- Sound and color should work together — players condition themselves to associate both

\- Minimalism can be more powerful than detailed graphics — imagination fills in the gaps



\#### Next Steps

\- Apply color theory concepts to future game designs

\- Think about how Utopia Works' visual identity could use color psychology

\- Continue developing studio branding
